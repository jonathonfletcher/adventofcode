# Advent of Code

## Advent of Code 2024

See [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

No specific language this year.

## Advent of Code 2021

See [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

Time to learn [go](https://go.dev/). And .. fallback to [python](https://www.python.org/) when I feel like it ..

## Advent of Code 2020

See [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

Seems like a good opportunity to learn [Rust](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

I am pushing code around the time that I answer the question on the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) site. There is so much that I want to clean up in this repo but it is interesting (and more realistic in a quiz setting) to keep the code used to answer the questions rather than trying to improve the solution afterwards.

Note: I did go back and move the Regex::new() into lazy_static! closures for day04..

Note: At some point the puzzles became hard enough that I was getting blocked on the combination of the problem and of the solution-in-rust. Solving the problem was a higher priority for me, so some of the later solutions are currently in python / c.
